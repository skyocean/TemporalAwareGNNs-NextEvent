\## üìñ Overview  

\*\*\[Download Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/XXXX.XXXXX)\*\*  

This repository provides a collection of \*\*Graph Neural Network (GNN)\*\* models for \*\*next-event prediction\*\* in predictive business process monitoring (PBPM). The framework includes both \*\*prefix-based GCNs\*\* for subgraph-level modeling and \*\*full-trace GATs\*\* with dynamic temporal windows and transition-aware edge embeddings. A suite of interpretability visualizations is also provided.



\### Key Features:

\- \*\*Full-trace attention\*\* with time-decay to prioritize temporally relevant context  

\- \*\*Prefix-based GCNs\*\* for localized sequence modeling and comparative benchmarking  

\- \*\*Transition-type edge embeddings\*\* for capturing semantic relationships between events  

\- \*\*Joint prediction of sub-status and activity label\*\* for contextual accuracy  

\- \*\*Multilevel interpretability\*\*, including different type of visualizations
